Objective: modify Example-ClearScreen-v2.cpp so that it clears the window to red, not green.

How Achieved

        The pixel shader assignment
             pColor = vec4(0, 1, 0, 1);
        was changed to
  pColor = vec4(1, 0, 0, 1);

        The app title was changed in the call to glfwCreateWindow.
